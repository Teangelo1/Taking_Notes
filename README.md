## Goal: 
The goal was to modify starter code to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

The frontend code was already created, Implementing the backend code was the main task.


## User Story

```
AS i come across idea's in my head
I WANT to be able to write and save them as a note
SO THAT I can keep track of my thoughts and view them when needed
```


## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a application when taking notes
WHEN I open the Note taking app
THEN I am presented with a page that says "get started"
WHEN I click the "get started " button
THEN I am taken to a new page
UPON heading to a new page
THEN I am presented with the option to type in a Note Title and Text
NEXT once i'm done with my note, i am presented with a save button
